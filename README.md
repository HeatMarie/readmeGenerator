### Comments

Sometimes you just get it! That was how it worked with this project. I'm not sure if it's because the more you write code the more you just know how to find a way to figure it out, or if it has to do with spending more time on just solid code, or because Node.js just like me *shrugs*. 

What I do know is that it came easier. That doesn't mean less time was spent on it, no. Instead, I spent more time playing with extra things like adding in the gif, and the name into the License, and maybe adding in too many licenses, but hey they do exist and you never truly know when you are going to use one. 

I like how the code looks clean, and simple but behind the scenes it does something amazing. It's like magic, and I *really* like magic.  

  ## Installation
 1. Ensure you have a code editor installed on your system. 
 2. Fork this code 
 3. Ensure you have node.js installed 
 4. Use npm i, npm i inquirer, npm util (if util does not appear after install i). 

  ## Usage
  When you don't want to spend the time outlining all the things. Use this. It will generate a README and save you time.
